        >Atticus said to Jem one day,
        <q
          >I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you'll go
          after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but
          remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.</q
        >
        That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do
        something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.
        <q>Your father's right,</q> she said.
        <q
          >Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy.
          They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they
          don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a
          sin to kill a mockingbird.</q

    <h1>Extract from "In Search of Lost Time"-- Marcel Proust,</h1>
    <p class="extract">
      <q
        >We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with
        our desires-we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable
        outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass
        and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in
        accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The
        situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes
        unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were
        absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us
        beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the
        past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.
